Quality testing of food grains using image processing and
neural network

In this repository, we present the paper A Probalistic Neural Network Approach To Food Grain Purity Analysis. One of the significant factors of food grain purity is measured by the percentage of foreign grains mixture. Most food traders used to verify the purity of food grain by Manual annotations done by laborers with years of experience. But this process is Costly and produces an erroneous result in most cases. Which also takes a very long time. So this work is going to find the purity of a food grain sample within a few seconds and with very good accuracy from a scanned image of the sample. The ultimate result will detect each grain and classify it to its corresponding grain type.

Acquiring food grain images is considered the most important step of the grain recognition process, as it determines the final grain image quality, which in turn dramatically affects the system's overall performance. Approximately 200 food grain images are acquired. A total of around 200 food grain images are acquired. The dataset contains images of different food grains such as wheat, horse gram, corn, and rice.

USAGE
All the working and programming is done in MatLab.So the MatLab software is to be downloaded, then add these project folders to the Matlab working environment, and then run the Foodgraingui.fig file to run the project. Then all the operations are specified in the Gui window and training is performed.
